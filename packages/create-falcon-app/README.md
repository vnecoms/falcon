# Create Falcon App

This CLI tool helps you to create your application based on [DEITY Falcon](https://github.com/deity-io/falcon) with just one command.

## TL;DR

Generate your app with:
```bash
npx create-falcon-app my-app
```

then run the server app in one terminal:
```bash
cd my-app/server
npm start
```
and the client app in the second terminal:
```bash
cd my-app/client
npm start
```
then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

## Longer version

### How to generate application?

You can use either npx (installed with npm) or yarn to generate the application. 

If you prefer npx use the following command:
```bash
npx create-falcon-app my-app
```

and if you prefer yarn use `yarn create` with the following syntax (notice space between `create` and `falcon-app`):
```bash
yarn create falcon-app my-app
```

That command will create `my-app` folder with 2 folders inside: 
```
my-app/
 |- server
 |- client
```

Folder `server` contains server application which is responsible for communication with external APIs and services.
Folder `client` contains client application responsible for front-end rendering.

Once `npx create-falcon-app my-app` or `yarn create falcon-app my-app` is done you can start both services. In one terminal window run the following commands to start the server part:
```bash
cd my-app/server
npm start # or yarn start
```
in the second terminal run the following commands to start the client part:
```bash
cd my-app/client
npm start # or yarn start
```

### Selecting the template for your project during generation

Currently we provide just one template for the generator which delivers basic features of shop and blog (the template itself is called [shop-with-blog](https://github.com/deity-io/falcon/tree/master/examples/shop-with-blog).

In the future we'll provide more templates that can be selected with `--example` option. Full command that uses `shop-with-blog`  in that case will be as following:
```bash
npx create-falcon-app --example shop-with-blog my-app
```

You can also use `npx create-falcon-app -h` (or `yarn create falcon-app -h`) to get the list of the available templates and options.

### Using your backend services

By default `shop-with-blog` example uses demo Magento 2 and WordPress servers provided by DEITY so you can check how DEITY Falcon works. If you cannot start the server part (from server folder) or you see any problems with server behavior please contact us via our [community slack channel](http://slack.deity.io). 

If you want to connect the generated app to your own Magento 2 backend you will need to install [Falcon Magento2 module](https://github.com/deity-io/falcon-magento2-module) which delivers REST endpoints required by DEITY Falcon and change configuration file (placed in `server/config/default.json`) to point the application to the correct url.

Also if you want to connect DEITY Falcon app to your WordPress server you'll have to to install [Falcon WordPress module](https://github.com/deity-io/falcon-wordpress-module) and also change configuration file (`server/config/default.json`) to point the application to the correct server.
